# Thinkpad X1 Windows 10 Middle Mouse Button Fix

The middle mouse button on Thinkpads can be used together with the TrackPointer to scroll windows without having to move the pointer to the scrollbar.  This is a feature that has worked on Thinkpads with MS Windows for several years.

Unfortunately, this feature clashes with Windows 10 Cortana on my fresh Thinkpad X1 Carbon (2016).  Scrolling does work as previously, but it also triggers the big Cortana search window/panel to pop up.  More precisely, Cortana pops up as soon as you press the middle mouse button.  I made a brief [Youtube screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OrSnRtoT6w) illustrating the problem.  Others [report the same problem](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?q=thinkpad+x1+middle+button+cortana+opens), e.g. [Thinkpad X1](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-X-Series-Laptops/X1-middle-button-keeps-opening-Cortana-diver-updated-disabled/m-p/3322230/highlight/true#M69979), [Thinkpad X260](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-X-Series-Laptops/x260-ultranav-middle-button-opens-Cortana/m-p/3322349), [Thinkpad T460s](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T460s-Middle-button-keeps-opening-Cortana/m-p/3314561/highlight/true#M108863).
